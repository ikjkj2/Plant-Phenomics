Abstract:
Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral imaging is one of the most widely used technologies for rapid crop monitoring, essential for crop-growth management. However, the technology’s complex optical structure and difficulty in interpreting real-time crop-growth information seriously restrict its application. 
This paper presents a newly designed UAV-based snapshot multispectral imaging crop-growth sensor (SMICGS) aimed at simplifying the optical structure and realizing the online interpretation of crop spectral information. Mosaic filters based on the special spectral characteristics of crops were designed to achieve multiband co-optical imaging.
A spectral crosstalk correction method based on the pixel response characteristics of SMICGS was proposed, and a processing system based on the coupling of sensor information and crop-growth monitoring models was developed to realize real-time online processing of crop spectral information. 
Field experiments showed that the vegetation indices obtained by SMICGS combined with the machine learning algorithm random forest (RF) achieved better results in predicting leaf area index (LAI) and above-ground biomass (AGB) for wheat and rice. 
For wheat, the R² and root mean square error (RMSE) values for the LAI and AGB prediction models were 0.81 and 0.85, and 0.682 and 1.127 t/ha, respectively. For rice, the R² and RMSE values for the LAI and AGB prediction models were 0.89 and 0.93, and 0.818 and 0.866 t/ha, respectively. 
Overall, SMICGS provides a reliable foundational tool for real-time, non-destructive monitoring of field crop growth information, offering significant potential for the precise management of agricultural production.
